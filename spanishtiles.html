    <h1>Saturday Noon, Summer</h1>
    <body>
        “The ground,”
        <br>
        Thinks the sparrow,
        <br>
        Naked in its youth
        <br>
        And pink in its flesh
        <br>
        As it plummets from the
        <br>
        Spanish tiles
        <br>
        Onto the sidewalk.
        <br>
        Winged and for what;
        <br>
        This temporary weightlessness is not flight. 
        <br>
        No, it is the lie of gravity
        <br>
        And the truth of impact.
        <br>
        Beak twisted in a sinusoidal scowl,
        <br>
        Eyes closed, never having seen the skies
        <br>
        But only the blackness of the end of everything 
        <br>
        And the ants it feeds.
        <br>
        A quick whisk of the shovel
        <br>
        And now it lies bound
        <br>
        Under the gravity shackles
        <br>
        Winged and flightless,
        <br>
        Too young to be free.
        <br>
        Three days of life
        <br>
        And not having lived at all.
