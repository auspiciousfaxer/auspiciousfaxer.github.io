    <h1>An Analysis of Immortal Hulk and Invisible Man</h1>
    <body>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspImmortal Hulk is a 50-issue comic run on Marvel’s Hulk by Al Ewing. The series takes a more horror-driven approach to Bruce Banner and the Hulk's story, exploring the psychological and supernatural aspects of the character. It introduces a concept known as the Green Door, which serves as a gateway between life and death for everyone affected by gamma radiation. Multiple personalities of the Hulk also appear, each one representing a different aspect of Bruce’s personality. Devil Hulk is the manifestation of the violent and darkest thoughts Bruce had as a child. It presents itself as the protective father figure Bruce wishes he had. Savage Hulk is the less intelligent, childlike Hulk that represents Bruce’s repressed childhood rage and depression that stems from his abusive father. Finally, the Grey Hulk, who goes by the name Joe Fixit, is a cunning, selfish Hulk who greatly values material possessions and was once a Las Vegas casino boss. Aside from the Hulk, there are two other major gamma mutates: Brian Banner and Samuel Sterns. Brian Banner is Bruce’s abusive father, who believed his son was a freak of nature due to Brian’s years of experimentation on gamma radiation. Samuel Sterns, also known as the Leader, is Bruce’s first cousin, who gains an incredibly great intellect after a freak accident involving gamma radiation. He learns how to open, close, and enter the Green Doors of other gamma mutates, effectively taking over their bodies.

        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor this project, I looked at the theme of “authoring your own identity,” which I interpreted as gaining individuality and taking control of one’s own destiny. Ewing explores this theme through Bruce’s interactions with the multiple personalities of Hulk and the Banners. The series encounters two major conflicts. First, there is abundant infighting between Bruce’s multiple personalities, each of them attempting to gain dominance over the others. However, as the series progresses, we see the different Hulks begin to collaborate more, as they all try to be better people and start helping the innocent instead of accomplishing their own agendas. Second, the Leader takes control over some of the Hulks via the Green Door, and is quite literally able to make them do whatever he so desires. However, when the Hulk personalities begin to collaborate, they finally become strong enough to defeat the Leader and take control over their own actions.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMuch like Immortal Hulk, Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man also has the main character experience different identities. The narrator begins as a naïve optimist -- he is a young and ambitious Black man full of hope. He believes that hard work and education will eventually lead to success and acceptance in society. From the quote “But more than that, [Bledsoe] was the example of everything I hoped to be: Influential with wealthy men all over the country; consulted in matters concerning the race; a leader of his people; the possessor of not one, but two Cadillacs, a good salary and a soft, good-looking and creamy-complexioned wife.” (79), it is clear that the narrator associates material possessions and appearance with success and social status. In his naïvety, however, he fails to understand the complexities and compromises that lie beneath Bledsoe’s seeming success and is manipulated into striving to become a Black man who is subservient to white people while putting down other Black people. When the narrator joins the Brotherhood, he is given another definition of success and he takes on the identity of a dedicated political activist. However, the Brotherhood takes advantage of his idealism and desire for social change, using him as a spokesperson for their own selfish agenda of gaining a spot on the national political stage. 
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThroughout Immortal Hulk, Hulk and Bruce are also manipulated multiple times. Like the narrator admiring Bledsoe, when Savage Hulk attempts to earn the love of Brian Banner (who is actually the Leader,) he is easily subdued and taken captive. Savage Hulk tries to appease the demands of an oppressive authority figure and ends up losing his freedom, instead of earning the success he thought he would have. Just like when the narrator joins the Brotherhood in an attempt to fight against racism, Devil Hulk completely falls into his label as a monster, and declares war on humanity. This does not actually give him his freedom either. Just like the narrator, he joins a side that opposes the system of oppression that was controlling him earlier, but ends up losing his freedom just the same. In this case, Devil Hulk’s rage prevents him from thinking clearly and he, too, is captured by the Leader.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the end of Invisible Man, the narrator becomes the Invisible Man, a creation entirely of his own, without the influence of anyone else, such as Bledsoe or the Brotherhood -- “And my problem was that I always tried to go in everyone’s way but my own. I have also been called one thing and then another while no one really wished to hear what I called myself. So after years of trying to adopt the opinions of others I finally rebelled. I am an invisible man.” (447) This is when the narrator is the most powerful. No longer is he subject to societal expectations of white men, nor is he a pawn in anybody else’s agenda. He is free to forge his own destiny. At the end of Immortal Hulk, all of the Hulk personalities realize that they need each other to exist. Just like the Invisible Man, no one identity of the Hulk is enough to survive. Each Hulk (and Bruce) brings an integral part to Bruce’s overall personality -- Devil Hulk’s assertiveness, Savage Hulk’s innocence and drive to do good, Joe Fixit’s cunning, and Bruce’s intelligence and rationale. Only when they work together are they able to regain control over their Green Doors from the Leader. However, when given the opportunity to kill the Leader, Hulk spares him. Hulk is labeled as a multitude of things, like “man,” “monster,” or “breaker.” What he is, however, is a continually changed beast. His past does not define him. Despite the generational hate and rage stemming back to Bruce’s father or the public’s insistence that he is a mindless brute, Hulk has the ability to choose mercy; he can choose to be good. Despite what society thinks of him, he does not need his rage to be strong. Rather, his strength comes from his ability to ignore the labels others put on him and make his own path.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy analysis of Immortal Hulk and Invisible Man has revealed to me how commonly American literature grapples with the theme of identity. Both pieces of work show their protagonists struggle to define themselves under guidelines imposed by others, and ultimately achieve success when they are able to shed those guidelines altogether. None of them are able to be defined by a single thing, be it “Black man” or “monster,” because to be American is to be the product of a multitude of cultures and backgrounds.
